This repo contains BookUM, the final project that our team, "The Runtime Terrors," designed and implemented within 24 hours for the University of Maryland hackathon, Daemon Dash 2014. 

BookUM is a textbook swap customized for UMD students in which sellers can store textbook information for specific courses and specify whether they would like to sell (in which case they name a price) or swap (in which case they choose course books to swap they would be willing to swap for). The buyer can then access that information by searching for the course they want books for.
